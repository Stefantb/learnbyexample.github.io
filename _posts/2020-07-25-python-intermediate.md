What to learn next is an often asked question. [Searching for `what next` on /r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/search?q=what+next&restrict_sr=on) gives you too many results. Here's some more Q&A and articles on this topic:

* [I know how to program, but I don't know what to program](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/i-know-how-program-i-dont-know-what-program)

## Exercises and Projects

I do not have a simple answer to this question either. If you feel comfortable with programming basics and Python syntax, then exercises are a good way to test your knowledge. The resource you used to learn Python will typically have some sort of exercises, so those would be ideal as a first choice. I'd also suggest using the below resources to improve your skills. If you get stuck, reread the material related to those topics, search online, ask for clarifications, etc  — in short, make an effort to solve it. It is okay to skip some troublesome problems (and come back to it later if you have the time), but you should be able to solve most of the beginner problems. Maintaining notes will help too, especially for common mistakes.

Once you are comfortable with basics and syntax, the next step is projects. I use a 10-line program that solves a common problem for me — adding `body { text-align: justify }` to `epub` files that are not justify aligned. I didn't know that this line would help beforehand, I searched online for a solution and then automated the process of unzipping `epub`, adding the line and then packing it again. That will likely need you to lookup documentation and go through some stackoverflow Q&A as well. And once you have written the solution and use it regularly, you'll likely encounter corner cases and features to be added. I feel this is a great way to learn and understand programming.
